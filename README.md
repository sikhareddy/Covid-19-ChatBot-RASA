# Covid-19-ChatBot-RASA-

Summary
This project's main aim and objective are to build a Chatbot for questions regarding the coronavirus. Every website uses a Chatbot to interact with the users and help them out.
This has proven to reduce the time and resources used to a great extent. The coronavirus outbreak has significant consequences for society worldwide. People are rightly concerned and have many urgent questions. 
The World Health Organization provides answers to frequently asked questions regarding the coronavirus. However, you may have to search for a while before finding the correct answer to your question. 
People must be well informed about current measures. This way, we can efficiently limit the mass spread and achieve herd immunity. A chatbot could ideally help with this! 
This chatbot is developed using RASA (Receive, Appreciate, Summarize, Ask) Framework and NLP (Natural Language Processing}.  


Problem Statement
In the light of the global COVID19 pandemic, it is now doubly important for the governments of various states to increase and inject funding into healthcare and medicine. 
This will also prompt the demand for the technological infrastructure. This is where an automated Chatbot dealing with medical issues can provide respite to many. 
So, we have to make a Chatbot using Natural Language Processing and Rasa that helps users in issues due to COVID19 by answering questions like: 
●	Precautionary measures
●	Availability of medical health professionals
●	Medicines availability
●	Basic amenities like food, water, grocery, etc. 
●	 Nearest testing centres, nearby shelter homes
●	Statistics based on districts or states in India


Technologies used-

●	DL
●	NLP
●	RASA
